# repo_tree

Experiment to try to pull from multiple repos.
I guess this is some sort of package manager.
The idea is to allow for modular git pulling.
So have an ignored list of repos that you pull from and then pull those sub repos.
The reason I thought of this is to make my .sharc bashrc more modular and allow for only downloading the aliases you care about.
I'm sure this has been done before.
